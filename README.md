Additional notes from the presentation: 

=CSV Import= 

Included in this package are two different examples of how to import CSV files into Gephi. Note that the rows are separated by new lines, and the columns are split by commas. Note an important thing: Gephi is not so smart, so we have to wrap each cell (in Excel parlance) with a double quote so that it's crystal clear what the file is doing. In practice, you need to make sure that each cell is wrapped with quote marks to make it crystal clear.
